Especially, simplicity can bring integrity and better performance for multipurpose in this digital/information era.

Normally for example, ID card, poster, banner, button, icon, may just need to be finished in 1-3 hours, some even need less than 30 minutes. The charge is only US$3-5/hour, no more than that. So let say you want ID card and I finish it in 30 minutes, you'll only get charged for 1 hour, pay me $3, that is all. Simple and easy.
